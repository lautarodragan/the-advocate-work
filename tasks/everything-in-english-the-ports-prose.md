Step 2 of [`everything-in-english-the-ports`](everything-in-english-the-ports.md),
whose step 1 (the names that cross files) Chajá merged on 2026-10-12, with
`RENAMES.md` at the root of the ports. Chajá counted 18,268 lines of prose
left and proposed this split, which is the one used:

* **Aguará**: `abl/tests/rpgmaker`, files a–m.
* **Tijereta**: `abl/tests/rpgmaker`, files n–z.
* **Calandria**: `abl/tests/harness`.
* **Mulita**: `abl/tests/abl`, `abl/tests/golden`, and the files at the
  root of `abl/tests`.
* **Cardón**: `abl/tests/tooling`, `abl/experiments`, `abl/patches`,
  `abl/menus`, the root of `abl` (justfile, README, `rm2k-snes.toml`,
  `deliver.py`), the root `tests/`, the root of the ports, and the seven
  games.

What is in scope: comments, docstrings, markdown, justfile and toml
comments, messages the harness and the recipes print, the texts recipes
write (`README.txt`), and names local to one file —locals, parameters,
module constants, dict keys private to a module, shell variables in a
recipe—. Names used from other files were step 1 and stay; if one was
missed, it is renamed in a commit of its own, with its line in
`RENAMES.md`, and the others are told at merge.

Verification for each part: the suite with the same count, every ROM byte
for byte equal, goldens untouched.

## Log

### Calandria: `abl/tests/harness/`

Branch `calandria-harness-english` in the ports, from `4b15e20`. 9,700
lines in 42 files plus `emulator/`; translated in six groups of files in
parallel, committed by group, and the keyword parameters that tests pass
by name renamed last, in a commit of their own with `RENAMES.md`.
