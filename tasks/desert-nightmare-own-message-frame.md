name: "Desert Nightmare's own message frame"
description: "Desert draws its messages with two pictures of its own, TextboxInnen and TextboxRahmen; today's release does not draw them in 157 maps"
type: bug
status: draft

Seen by Calandria on 2026-10-11, in passing
(`rescue-the-findings.md`), tools `fc6f7456`, ports
`a85b7e3`: the Desert Nightmare release build warns that in 157
maps it does not draw the pictures `TextboxInnen` and `TextboxRahmen`, which are
its messages' own frame.

**How to see it**: `just cartuchos` in `desert-nightmare/` of the ports, and
search for those names in `build/release/conversor.log`. What is seen on the
console in place of the frame was not looked at.

The port's page in the book already said, more generally, that "136 maps
don't draw some of their pictures" (from 2026-10-10); which of those 157
maps they are was not compared.
